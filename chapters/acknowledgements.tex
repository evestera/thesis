I would like to thank my supervisors, Volker Stolz and Martin Steffen, for their guidance and feedback, as well as for their trust in me from the moment I approached them with my own idea, and throughout my forays into exploring other ideas within Rust for this thesis.

I would also like to thank my family for their support, and in particular my wife, Anette, for her valuable feedback, and her wonderful drawings of Ferris, the Rust mascot, which make this thesis a little more pleasant to look at.

Finally, I would like to thank the Rust community, as every interaction with someone from the Rust community, whether over IRC, online forums or in person, has continually shown me that beyond the Rust language, the community that is \emph{around} Rust in itself makes Rust worth investing time and energy into.
